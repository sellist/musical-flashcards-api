- Maven

## Build and run
- Build: `mvn clean package`
- Run: `mvn spring-boot:run` or `java -jar target/flashcards-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

  `/notes?notes=C%234,Ab5,F3`
- Other endpoints provide scale and card utilities. See source for details.

/*
generateNoteByMidiValue works with the first argument as the midi value of the note, and the second argument is the modifier
of the base note, can think of it as a cache signifier (generateNoteByMidiValue(60,0) would return C4, generateNoteByMidiValue(61,1) would return C#4)
